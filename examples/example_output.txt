FOR: SpaceX Data Science Intern
================================

A. Job Details Recap
   Company: SpaceX
   Focus: Predictive maintenance for rockets
   Key Skills: Python, ML, Time-series analysis

B. Technical Questions

<question>
  <type>Technical</type>
  <text>Explain how you would build a predictive maintenance model for rocket engines
        using sensor data. What features would you engineer and which algorithms
        would you consider?</text>
  <guidance>
    <evaluating>Technical approach, domain understanding, practical ML knowledge</evaluating>
    <structure>
      1. Clarify the problem (what counts as "failure"?)
      2. Describe data exploration approach
      3. Explain feature engineering (sensor trends, anomaly detection)
      4. Suggest 2-3 appropriate algorithms (Random Forest, LSTM, etc.)
      5. Discuss evaluation metrics (precision/recall tradeoff)
      6. Mention production considerations
    </structure>
    <key_points>
      - Time-series nature of sensor data
      - Class imbalance (failures are rare)
      - Importance of false negatives vs false positives
      - Need for model interpretability (safety-critical)
    </key_points>
    <example>
      "I'd start by exploring the sensor data to understand normal operating
       patterns versus anomalies. For features, I'd create rolling statistics,
       rate-of-change metrics, and cross-sensor correlations. Given the time-series
       nature and need for interpretability, I'd try Random Forest first for
       baseline, then explore LSTM networks if sequence patterns are important.
       For this safety-critical application, I'd optimize for recall to catch
       all potential failures, even at the cost of some false alarms."
    </example>
    <avoid>
      - Don't jump straight to complex models without explaining simpler baselines
      - Don't ignore the business context (rocket safety!)
      - Don't forget about model deployment challenges
    </avoid>
  </guidance>
</question>

<question>
  <type>Technical</type>
  <text>Walk me through how you would evaluate if your predictive maintenance model
        is working well in production.</text>
  <guidance>
    <evaluating>Understanding of ML operations, metrics, real-world deployment</evaluating>
    <structure>
      1. Define success metrics (technical and business)
      2. Explain monitoring approach
      3. Discuss A/B testing strategy
      4. Mention feedback loops
    </structure>
    <key_points>
      - Precision/Recall in production vs training
      - Cost of false positives (unnecessary maintenance)
      - Cost of false negatives (catastrophic failure)
      - Model drift detection
      - Feedback from maintenance teams
    </key_points>
    <example>
      "I'd track both technical metrics like precision/recall and business
       metrics like maintenance cost savings and prevented failures. Set up
       dashboards to monitor prediction distribution and alert on model drift.
       Crucially, I'd establish a feedback loop with maintenance engineers
       to validate predictions and continuously improve the model."
    </example>
  </guidance>
</question>

C. Behavioral Questions

<question>
  <type>Behavioral</type>
  <text>Tell me about a time you worked with messy or incomplete data. How did
        you handle it?</text>
  <guidance>
    <evaluating>Real-world experience, problem-solving, resourcefulness</evaluating>
    <structure>Use STAR method:
      Situation: Describe the project and data quality issues
      Task: What you needed to accomplish
      Action: Specific steps you took to handle messy data
      Result: What happened, what you learned
    </structure>
    <key_points>
      - Be specific about the data quality issues (missing values, outliers, etc.)
      - Explain your decision-making process
      - Show both technical skills and communication
      - Mention any preventive measures for future
    </key_points>
    <example>
      "In my university capstone project analyzing COVID-19 data, we found 30%
       missing values in key columns and inconsistent date formats across sources.
       I first documented all data quality issues, then implemented a cleaning
       pipeline using Pandas: standardized dates, imputed missing values using
       appropriate methods (median for numerical, mode for categorical), and
       flagged outliers for review. I also created a data quality report to
       communicate findings to the team. This ensured our analysis was based
       on reliable data, and we documented all assumptions made during cleaning."
    </example>
  </guidance>
</question>

[... Similar detailed questions for other companies ...]

D. Company-Specific Questions

<question>
  <type>Role-specific</type>
  <text>Why do you want to work at SpaceX specifically, and why data science?</text>
  <guidance>
    <evaluating>Genuine interest, company research, career goals</evaluating>
    <key_points>
      - Show you've researched SpaceX's mission
      - Connect your interests to their work
      - Be authentic and passionate
      - Mention specific SpaceX projects/achievements
    </key_points>
    <example>
      "I've been fascinated by SpaceX's mission to make humanity multi-planetary
       since watching the Falcon Heavy launch in 2018. What excites me about
       this data science role specifically is the opportunity to apply ML to
       something so tangible - rocket reliability directly impacts mission success.
       I love that data science at SpaceX isn't just optimizing ad clicks; it's
       enabling space exploration. I'm particularly interested in your work on
       Starship and would love to contribute to making it the most reliable
       spacecraft ever built."
