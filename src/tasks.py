Task definitions for the Job Search AI Agent System.

This module defines all tasks that agents will perform. In CrewAI, tasks
represent specific pieces of work with clear descriptions, expected outputs,
and assigned agents.

Think of tasks as work orders that tell agents:
- What to do (description)
- What the result should look like (expected_output)
- Which other tasks to consider (context)
- Where to save the results (output_file)

Author: Claude Builder Club @ UC Irvine
Workshop: Intro to AI Agents (October 20, 2025)

Best Practices Applied:
- Anthropic: Clear, specific task descriptions with step-by-step instructions
- Anthropic: Expected output format specified for consistent results
- CrewAI: Task chaining through context parameter
- CrewAI: File output for persistence and review
